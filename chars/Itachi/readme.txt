1. Introduction (Naruto spoilers ahead)
---------------------

Finally... Woff, after all this time, I finished this character. I gave
my best on him, so I hope you like it. It took me 45 days (whoa!) to make
him, so I hope you appreciate all the effort I gave on it.
So... Why Itachi? Well, I have 2 reasons. 1) There're no good Itachi chars
out yet. 2) Since I made both Naruto and Sasuke, I thought in making another
central characters of the series. The first one I thought in: Itachi.
This is a char I'm making as part of the KyubiMugen Team (hence the KM), this
means it'll go for the game NS: TLG, so you better try it out, cos I'll make
some chars there XD

2. Credits

 for the char, and supported me with a lot of sprites. Thanks a lot, man.

 they should be there.

 stop the illusion.

-DO NOT DARE TO EDIT THIS CHAR. And, if possible, don't make mirrors: just take my link
 from 4shared ^^.
