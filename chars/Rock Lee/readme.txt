 - Who? -
 --------
 * Rock Lee is an awsome fighter from the Village hidden in the Leaves (Konoha's Village), he has a somewhat weird       relationship with his Senei Gai, although this may seem a bit strange, they share their uniqueness; both only really being    able to use Taijutsu, this hasnt stopped them though and they are experts at opening their inner gates. Gai sensei is a big   inspiration to Lee with this problem, he was the only one there for Lee and the one that cared the most.


  No matter who the opponent, Lee always shows respect and never attempts to demean them. As an academy student, he was     teased for his inability, leading him to spend all his time and concentration on taijutsu under the guidance of his sensei,   Might Guy. Through practice, he has become so overcompensatingly strong in the taijutsu discipline that he was allowed to     graduate the ninja academy with his teammate and rival Neji Hyuga. Neji originally claimed that Lee was not really a ninja    since he can't use genjutsu or ninjutsu, saying that just because Lee is the first student who graduated from the academy     with only taijutsu doesn't mean that he is amazing, just unusual.
