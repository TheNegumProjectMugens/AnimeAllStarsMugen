1.Introduction
--------------
Thanks for downloading my M.U.G.E.N. Pokemon Trainer character. The char is created by me
(MGSSJ2). He is a character from the Super Smash Bros Brawl game. The style is based on the game,
but the attacks are from the Pokemon series. 
Char is 3 characters in 1. Pokemon Trainer uses 3 different pokemons to fight (Ivysaur, Squirtle,
and Charizard). You can change between them in mid=battle. Once one is KO'd, the other one gets on
the fight, and so on, til there's no Pokemon alive. Then, you lose.

2.Credits
