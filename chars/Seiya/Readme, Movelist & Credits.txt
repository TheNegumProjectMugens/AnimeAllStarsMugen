First of all, I thank existence, because without that, we couldn't experience anything, and this is the biggest gift we got since we born.
Pegasus sprite by khuraudo, I've edit some sprite.
Sagittarius sprite by GregarLink10, recolored by me.
Hyoga sprite by khuraudo.
FX and some code from Mikel8888, Hermoduro, Alexei Roschak, NBA01,  Wolf Stak, Shinrashi, CLIFF-A etc....(sorry if i forgot someone) 
Thank to Ryon for his great tutorial, giving me the spirit to make my own chars!
Thank to everyone who enjoy playing mugen and sharing their creations!
